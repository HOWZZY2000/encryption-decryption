# Encryption-Decryption

This project includes a key generator and a cipher-decipher program using AES mode.   
The key generator is required to be run first to generate a random 16-byte string key.
The main program uses this key to encrypt and decrypt string messages.

# Usage
Importing external package:
```python
pip install pycryptodome
```
And test with:
~~~
python key_generator.py
python main.py 
~~~
